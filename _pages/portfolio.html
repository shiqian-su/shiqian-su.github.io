    <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
      TaCOS is a comprehensive full-stack system I independently developed from scratch to support student organizations and art groups at Tsinghua University. The system provides end-to-end solutions for information management, asset tracking, team organization, and day-to-day operations, significantly improving the efficiency and effectiveness of student organization management. This system has now been fully adopted by Tsinghua University Student Art Troupe Choir in their daily operations.
